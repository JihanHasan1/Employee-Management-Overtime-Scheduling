# Employee Management and Overtime Scheduling

Employee management is a key term for any industry. It’s often tough for a manager to handle employee’s data and their overtime scheduling using just a khata. Besides, the overtime scheduling is not well distributed in many cases. Hence, I have made this software for such case. By using the software an admin or a moderator can control employee data and distribute overtime scheduling by using my scheduling tool. Besides, Employees can also view their profile and overtime schedules.

**Features**:

1. Private Account
2. Data Validation Check for all Users
3. Assign New Moderators
4. Access Moderator List
5. Update Moderator Details
6. Delete Moderator
7. View Own Profile
8. Assign New Employee
9. Access Employee List
10. Update Employee Details
11. Delete Employee
12. Search from List
13. Overtime Scheduling
14. Access Overtime List
15. Contact for Support
